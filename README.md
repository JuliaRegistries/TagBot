## Setup using default `GITHUB_TOKEN` (recommended)

The recommended approach uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by GitHub Actions. This will work for most users.

**Step 1:** Create a file at `.github/workflows/TagBot.yml` with the following contents:

```yml
name: TagBot
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 * * * *
jobs:
  TagBot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: JuliaRegistries/TagBot@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

No further action is required.

## Setup using custom token

This approach uses a custom token that you provide. This is necessary in order to trigger GitHub actions CI from a tagbot tag, in order to build documentation for tagged versions of your package.

**Step 1:** Generate a GitHub personal access token. To do so, go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>, name it anything you wish, and select either `repo` or `public_repo`, depending on whether or not you will use tagbot with private repositories. Save this somewhere secret, like a password, so you can reuse the same token for each tagbot workflow deployment you make.

**Step 2:** Go to `https://github.com/MY_USERNAME/MY_REPOSITORY/settings/secrets`, click on `Add a new secret`, enter `TAGBOT_TOKEN` for `Name`, enter the token into the `Value` field, and then click the green `Add secret` button.

**Step 3:** Create a file at `.github/workflows/TagBot.yml` with the following contents:

```yml
name: TagBot
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 * * * *
jobs:
  TagBot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: JuliaRegistries/TagBot@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.TAGBOT_TOKEN }}
```

No further action is required.

### Changelogs

TagBot creates a changelog for each release based on the issues that have been closed and the pull requests that have been merged.
Additionally, you can write custom release notes in the same place that you register your packages.
See [Registrator](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/#release-notes) or [PkgDev](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl) for specifics.

The changelog is completely customizable with the [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine.
To supply your own template, use the `changelog` input:

```yml
with:
  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  changelog: |
    This is release {{ version }} of {{ package }}.
    {% if custom %}
    Here are my release notes!
    {{ custom }}
    {% endif %}
```

The data available to you looks like this:

```json
{
  "compare_url": "https://github.com/Owner/Repo/compare/previous_version...current_version (or null for first release)",
  "custom": "your custom release notes",
  "issues": [
    {
      "author": {
        "name": "Real Name",
        "url": "https://github.com/username",
        "username" "their login"
      },
      "body": "issue body",
      "labels": ["label1", "label2"],
      "merger": {"same format as": "issue author"},
      "number": 123,
      "title": "issue title",
      "url": "https://github.com/Owner/Repo/issues/123"
    }
  ],
  "package": "PackageName",
  "previous_release": "v1.1.2 (or null for first release)",
  "pulls": [
    {
      "author": {"same format as": "issue author"},
      "body": "pull request body",
      "labels": ["label1", "label2"],
      "merger": {"same format as": "issue author"},
      "number": 123,
      "title": "pull request title",
      "url": "https://github.com/Owner/Repo/pull/123"
    }
  ],
  "sha": "commit SHA",
  "version": "v1.2.3",
  "version_url": "https://github.com/Owner/Repo/tree/v1.2.3"
}
```

You can see the default template in [`action.yml`](action.yml).
It also allows you to exclude issues and pull requests from the changelog by adding the `changelog-skip` label to them.

### Custom Registries

If you're using a custom registry, add the `registry` input:

```yml
with:
  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  registry: MyOrg/MyRegistry
```

### Release Branch Management

If you're using [PkgDev](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl) to release your packages, TagBot can manage the merging and deletion of the release branches that it creates.
To enable this feature, use the `branches` input:

```yml
with:
  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  branches: true
```

### Pre-Release Hooks

If you want to make something happen just before releases are created, for example creating annotated, GPG-signed tags, you can do so with the `dispatch` input:

```yml
with:
  token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  dispatch: true
```

When you enable this option, a [repository dispatch event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#repositorydispatchevent) is created before releases are created.
This means that you can set up your own actions that perform any necessary pre-release tasks.
These actions will have 5 minutes to run.

The payload is an object mapping from version to commit SHA, which can contain multiple entries and looks like this:

```json
{
  "v1.2.3": "abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01"
}
```

To use this feature, you must provide your own personal access token instead of the default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, because that token does not have permission to trigger events.
